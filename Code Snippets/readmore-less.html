      <h3>what is Gravity?</h3>
      <p>Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that is responsible for the attraction between objects with mass. It is one of the four fundamental forces in the universe, along with electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. Gravity was first described by Sir Isaac Newton in the late 17th century and later refined by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity in the early 20th century.<a id="read_more_1" onclick="readMoreFun('hide_seek-1',this.id)" class="read_more">...Read More</a></p>
      <div class="hide_seek-1 hidden-content">
        <p>Attraction of Mass: Gravity is a force that attracts all objects with mass towards each other. The more massive an object is, the stronger its gravitational pull. This is why planets, stars, and other massive celestial bodies have strong gravitational fields.</p>
        <p>Inverse Square Law: According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:</p>
        <p>Acceleration Due to Gravity: All objects near the surface of the Earth experience a gravitational acceleration towards its center. On Earth, this acceleration is approximately 9.81 meters per second squared (m/s²). This means that for every second an object is in free fall, its speed increases by 9.81 meters per second.<a onclick="readMoreFun('hide_seek-1','read_more_1')" class="read_less">...Read Less</a></p>
